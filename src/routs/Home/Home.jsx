        Hi! I'm Amir Khosh, and I created this project
         to showcase characters, episodes, and locations
          from the Rick and Morty series. <br/>This project uses 
          the Rick and Morty API to fetch and display
           information about the characters, episodes,
            and locations.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        The project is built using the React library and 
        utilizes React Router for routing management.
         Additionally, CSS is used for styling.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        If you have any questions or want to get in touch
         with me, please feel free to contact me.
